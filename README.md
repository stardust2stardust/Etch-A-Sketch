# Etch-A-Sketch

A drawing app where the user can draw continuously over a grid.

There are 4 options to choose from for drawing:
  - black
  - grey
  - random color
  - erase (white)

The grid size defaults to 16x16 but can be changed to any size up to 100.

The user can start drawing on the default grid by clicking on a color option.
The colors can be clicked on as needed.

If the user changes the grid size, the grid will be reset to blank and drawing can 
start again once a color choice is selected.
